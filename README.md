# Psychonomics2018
Talk given at Psychonomics 2018 symposium: "Should Science Determine the Practice of Statistics or Should Statistics Determine the Practice of Science?"

There are two files:
  psychonomics_2018.pdf (the actual slides, including some extras at the end that I did not get to)
  psychonomics_2018_notes.pdf (my actual statements; I read the talk word for word, so this is a verbatim record of my presentation)
