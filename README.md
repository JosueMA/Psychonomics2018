# Psychonomics2018
Talk given at Psychonomics 2018 symposium: "Should Science Determine the Practice of Statistics or Should Statistics Determine the Practice of Science?"

There are two files:
  psychonomics_2018.pdf (the actual slides, including some extras at the end that I did not get to)
  psychonomics_2018_notes.pdf (my actual statements; I read the talk word for word, so this is a verbatim record of my presentation)
  
On 11/21, Rich Shiffrin's slides were added in the file "Symposium Psychonomics Final 2018.pptx".  Rich states, "[I am] not a user of
twitter, facebook, or any other form of social media, I had to be informed by others that my talk at the Psychonomic Society meetings in
New Orleans has produced discussion, some negative. It is best if outrage is expressed about what I actually said, rather than what
someone said I said, so I give my entire talk.

I am happy to debate any of these issues, or just hear directly expressions of other views, via email at shiffrin@indiana.edu."
